We like to pretend rationality is clean - this cold, surgical tool that separates us from myth and madness. But the uncomfortable truth is this: **rationality itself was born irrational.**

The first mathematicians weren’t lab rats of reason. They were priests and mystics. Babylonians tracked the stars for omens. Egyptians measured land for gods and taxes. Pythagoreans worshiped numbers as sacred. Algebra, algorithms, astronomy , all seeded in religion, ritual, and awe.  
So when we brag about logic as “pure,” we’re standing on foundations poured by myth.

## The flaw baked in

Our whole knowledge stack depends on sensory input. But senses are biased, lossy, and local. We saw the sun rise and swore the universe revolved around us. Took centuries of better instruments and different eyes to undo that mistake.  
Even now, how many of our “laws” are just slightly less-wrong patches on flawed starting points?
That’s the flaw of being human: our rationality isn’t a god-tier system. It’s an error-correcting machine duct-taped on top of bad priors.

## Enter AGI, stage left

Now we’re hyping AGI. But what do we even mean?  
- Human-level intelligence?  
- Or something *superior*?  

Either way, the benchmark is us , as if human cognition is the pinnacle of intelligence. That’s hubris. Our intelligence is just a survivor’s hack: dopamine loops, myths, biases, post-hoc narratives. If we build AGI in our image, we might just get **a faster irrationality machine.**

And if we try to build something “beyond human”? We’re still feeding it axioms that descend from religion, ritual, and flawed senses. That inheritance doesn’t just vanish because we wrapped it in silicon.

## The humility check

How dare we assume we’re the smartest in the universe?  
We’ve been around for a blink.  
We miss most of the spectrum.  
Our math was born in temples.  

Maybe we’re not birthing gods with AGI. Maybe we’re just cloning our own cracked mirror.

### Closing thought

Rationality grew out of irrationality. Knowledge crawled out of myth. And progress only happens because we admit our flaws and *iterate*.  

If AGI is ever going to be more than just “us but faster,” it’ll need what we struggle with: **a way to question its own foundations**. Otherwise, it’s just carrying our religious ghosts into the future.
